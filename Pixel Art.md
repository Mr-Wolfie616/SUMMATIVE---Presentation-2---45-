# Introduction
As my course is Immersive Technology I have decdied to do as much design as I can whilst focusing on developing code as that is my preference so for my personal project I have decided to create Pixel Art, sticking to a 16x16 or 32x32 size for my work. The main objective of this project is to try and create or re-ccreate charcters which could be used in a 2D pixel game. To keep with themes I enjoy I have decided that my work will keep to a more fantasy genre allowing me to express charaters which don't have to keep to realism allowing proportians and design ideas to be more creative and not need to follow a specific direction.
