# Introduction
As my course is Immersive Technology I have decdied to do as much design as I can whilst focusing on developing code as that is my preference so for my personal project I have decided to create Pixel Art, sticking to a 16x16 or 32x32 size for my work. The main objective of this project is to try and create or re-ccreate charcters which could be used in a 2D pixel game. To keep with themes I enjoy I have decided that my work will keep to a more fantasy genre allowing me to express charaters which don't have to keep to realism allowing proportians and design ideas to be more creative and not need to follow a specific direction. 

## Inspiration
For my Characters I first decdided to work on fantasy charaters, which i could find online. One of the main characters I decided to work on was a plague doctor with a nature twist to it allowing it to convey story in its design. I however then decided to change my idea, still keeping with the fantasy feel for my character however I wanted to try recreating characters from shows i enjoyed instead as this allowed me to work off of something that already existed as I do struggle to convey my creative Ideas into actual art. Due to this i Decided to use characters from fantasy Anime. The main ones I chose were:
- That Time I Got Reincarnated As A Slime
- Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash
- Arifureta: From Commonplace to World's Strongest
